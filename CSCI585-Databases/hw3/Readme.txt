// Assumptions

Part 1. - For vaccination.xsd, the problem description in Part 1 describes each Clinic as having 'Patients Served' while the data in Part 2 refers to 'Groups Served'. I inferred it as groups served and names it as such.

Part 2. - For vaccination.xml, I copied the data exactly from the pdf except for the table Patients. The SSN of Jim should have an extra digit, so I added one more 2 (222-22-2222).

Part 2. - For vaccination.xml, the patient clinic for Lee is 'HCCS' although there is no Clinic in the table with ID 'HCCS' (there is only HCC). However, I left the data in the xml file as 'HCCS'.

Part 2. - I included the reference to the XSLT stylesheet (vaccination.xsl) inside the vaccination.xml file.

Part 3. - I assumed that the headers for each table column are bold and that the background color only applies to the table data and not to the headers. Also, font sizes I assumed were in 'px'.
